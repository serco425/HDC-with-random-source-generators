# HDC-with-random-source-generators
Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) with Random Number Generators (Sobol &amp; LFSR)

This project references the previous GitHub repository on language classification via HDC by Dr. Abbas RAHIMI, https://github.com/abbas-rahimi/HDC-Language-Recognition

We have updated the random sequence generators for hypervectors in HDC to better yield classification accuracy.
